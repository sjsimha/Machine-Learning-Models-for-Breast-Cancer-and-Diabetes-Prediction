* The two datasets used are:
	* PIMA Indian Diabetes
	* Wisconsin Breast Cancer
   Although they could be downloaded from Kaggle and UCI (links available in references),
   however for running the programs local copies should be used - which are found under the "data" directory
   found under the overall root directory

* The project is implemented as stand-alone Python programs (with some some programs being reused, which is noted below)

* At a high level, there are 16 programs organized as follows:
    * There is one program "A1_Common.py" which contains common functions reused by all programs
    * Each algorithm has the following 3 programs:
         * <algorithm>_Common.py (contains code that is common to that algorithm only)
	 * <algorithm>_Pima.py (contains code for that algorithm for the Pima dataset)
	 * <algorithm>_Wisconsin.py (contains code for that algorithm for the Pima dataset)
    * The algorithm prefix is:
         Dtree - Decision Trees
	 Boosting - Boosting
	 KNN - Nearest Neighbors
	 NN - Neural Networks
	 SVM - Support Vector Machines
    * Any desired algorithm for a specific dataset can be executed by running the program that represents the combination of 
      the algorithm and dataset.
    * !!IMPORTANT!! pythonpath must be included in the program execution command and should include both the current directory
      and the parent directory
    * When any of the 10 programs are run, all charts and results will be written to the <results> directory (see directory structure below)
    * Code that runs grid search is commented out. They should be uncommented if they need to be run. That part of the code will look like below:
		   # a1c.perform_grid_search(clf, make_grid_search_params(), x_train, y_train, verbose=4, write_results=True,
    		   #                         file_name=gs_results_file_)
    * Not all programs have a grid search, since other techniques such as validation curves were used sometimes to select hyperparameters



* The programs were written in Python 3.11 and has the following dependencies:
	* matplotlib
	* numpy
	* pandas
	* sklearn

* The program directory structure is as follows:
	<root_dir>
		<data>
			breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv
			pima_diabetes.csv
		<results>
			[contains all charts and text result files]
